ctionary for Earth Language http://www.earthlanguage.org to and from the iwords of all languages, written for running on Google App Engine. An "iword" is a word that is disambiguated, and thus has only one meaning; usually, this is done by adding an index to a word, so that the combination of the index and the word corresponds to a single definition. Unlike words, iwords don't have homonyms.

A working example of the latest version: http://el-dict.appspot.com.

Note that you need to download and install earth3.ttf font to be able to use the dictionary. Currently, best viewed with Mozilla Firefox.

Currently, the code is very hastily written, unedited, and without using the MVC paradigm.
