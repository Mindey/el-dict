EL-Dict is a collection of iwords of all languages, mapped to each other. An iword is defined as simply a word that is disambiguated by adding an index (sid - sense id), and thus has only one meaning. In this application, there is only 1 big table of iwords. The table has the following columns:

{token, sid, sclue, freq, link, mapto}

token - simply a word       (e.g., "orange", "apple")
sid - the sense of the word (e.g., 1, 2,.. - incremented every time a new iword with the same token is added)
sclue - sense clue          (e.g., "colour", "fruit",.. - a short word or phrase that disambiguates the token, and turns it into an iword)
freq - usage frequency      (e.g., 1, 2,.. - incremented every time a user indicates that he or she used the word)
link - a url to an online resource (e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_%28colour%29 )
mapto - a list of keys to other iwords

Each iword has a unique key: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/keyclass.html
Each iword automatically belongs to a separate entity group: 'en', 'el', 'ja', 'lt', 'fi', etc. http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/entities.html

The idea of EL-Dict (Earth Language Dictionary) had arisen from 3 things:

    . The i-word concept [ http://concept.wikia.com ]
